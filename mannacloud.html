        <h2>Founder, Branding</h2>

        <h3>Project Summary</h3>
        <p>
          My fiancé and I founded MannaCloud in October, 2016. It is a small company that provides online services to churches, from design to hosting. So far, I’ve managed to create the brand and overall design for the website.
        </p><p>
          I started with the name, MannaCloud. I experimented with many types of logos, originally with a sky-blue primary color. I tried a variety of cloud silhouettes, until I finally settled on a style that was sharper. Since the rounded text didn’t really fit with the new style, I moved onto a more basic font for the type.
        </p><p>
          Next, I experimented with colors. I narrowed it down to two: Professional Blue, or Creative Purple. Since this was a creative agency, I was already leaning towards purple. I played around with different palettes and finally settled on some muted purples, with a complimentary teal accent.
        </p><p>
          While I was working on the wireframes, I took some time to do some low-fidelity color mockups. I wanted to make sure the way I was using the colors looked and felt comfortable throughout the composition. I then translated this to the final mockup. Revisions are still being made, but overall is heading in the right direction.
        </p><p>
          I’m really looking forward to continuing work on MannaCloud in the future. I’m hoping it can be a fulfilling side project that I can continue to develop in my spare time.
        </p>
